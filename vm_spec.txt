Simple-c virtual machine specification

must accept a simple-c program as defined below
must report if invalid file found
must report run-time errors (if any?)
must support i/o streaming

simple-c assembly specification:

header:
<program_name>
<num_instructions>
<instruction_list>

format of instructions:
<instruction> <op1> <op2> <op3> comments

instructions:
EXIT (0) - terminates the program
MEMREAD (1) - reads from memory location in <op1> with offset in <op2> and puts the result in <op3>
MEMWRITE (2) - writes to the memory location in <op1> with offset in <op2> the value in <op3>
ADD (3) - adds the value in <op1> to the value in <op2> and stores the result in <op3>
SUBTRACT (4) - subtracts the value in <op1> from the value in <op2> and stores the result in <op3>
INPUT (5) - reads a byte from input and stores it in <op1>
OUTPUT (6) - writes a byte from <op1> to the output stream

registers(8):
4 data registers (0/DATA0, 1/DATA1, 2/DATA2, 3/DATA3)
1 program counter (4/PC)
3 misc (5/MISC0, 6/MISC1, 7/MISC2)

calling:
either :
    scvm -p <program> (-m <memSize>)
or
    <instream> scvm (-m <memSize>)

if -m <memSize> is not specified, memory size is set to 256 bytes.
